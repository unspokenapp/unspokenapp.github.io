                <p>Welcome to Unspoken, a platform where genuine conversations spark every day. By using the Unspoken app ("the App"), a product of Talking Ventures LLC ("we," "our," or "us"), you agree to abide by the following Terms and Conditions. Please read them carefully before using our services.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>1. User Eligibility</h2>
                <p>Users must be at least 18 years old to access the App. Users between 13 and 17 years old are permitted to use the App with consent from a parent or legal guardian. We reserve the right to verify the age of any user at any time.</p>

                <h2>2. User Content and Reporting</h2>
                <p>Users can post text or images on the App. Users can also report inappropriate content, posts, comments, or profiles within the App, using the report option available under the "more" (ellipsis) button on each content piece. We encourage our community to actively report any content that violates these terms or is potentially harmful.</p>

                <h2>3. Content Sharing and License Grant</h2>
                <p>By posting content on the App, you grant Unspoken a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable, worldwide license to use, modify, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, and distribute such content on and through the platform, including for marketing and promotional purposes, without further notice to or consent from you, and without the requirement of payment to you or any other person or entity.</p>

                <p>This license enables users to share and repost content within the App and acknowledges the possibility of content being shared outside the App. We encourage users to share responsibly and respect the rights and dignity of others.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>4. Third-party Services</h2>
                <p>The App utilizes third-party services including Supabase (for database, storage, authentication), Firebase (for performance tracking, error logging, and monitoring), Twilio (for phone number verification via SMS), and OneSignal (for push notifications). These services assist in the overall functioning and enhancement of the App's features.</p>

                <h2>5. In-App Purchases</h2>
                <p>Currently, there are no in-app purchases available. However, we reserve the right to introduce in-app purchases in the future. Updates regarding this will be communicated appropriately.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>6. Security Measures</h2>
                <p>Accounts on the App are password-protected to enhance security. While we implement standard security measures, users are encouraged to safeguard their accounts by using strong passwords and keeping their login details confidential. We rely on the security measures provided by the third-party services mentioned in section 4 to protect users' data.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>7. Dispute Resolution and Governing Law</h2>
                <p>Any dispute arising from the use of the App will be resolved through arbitration in the jurisdiction of the United States, according to the laws governing this agreement. Users agree to resolve disputes through arbitration, which is a more informal process than a court trial.</p>
